# Circom Compatible Poseidon Hash

This crate contains a custom rust implementation of the Poseidon hash function, which is compatible with [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/).
Currently, only the parameters for Poseidon with statesizes t=3 (allows hashing two field elements) and t=4 (allows hashing three field elements) for the BN254 curve is present. However, different parameters can be generated with the `src/bn254/parameters.sage` script, which is a modified copy of the original Poseidon instance generation script from [https://extgit.iaik.tugraz.at/krypto/hadeshash/-/blob/master/code/generate_parameters_grain.sage](https://extgit.iaik.tugraz.at/krypto/hadeshash/-/blob/master/code/generate_parameters_grain.sage).

Usage (for the BN254 curve):

```sage
sage parameters.sage 1 0 254 <t> 8 <r> 0x30644e72e131a029b85045b68181585d2833e84879b9709143e1f593f0000001
```

where t is the statesize and r is the number of rounds. Circom uses the following round numbers for different statesizes t:

|  t |  r |
|----|----|
|  2 | 56 |
|  3 | 57 |
|  4 | 56 |
|  5 | 60 |
|  6 | 60 |
|  7 | 63 |
|  8 | 64 |
|  9 | 63 |
| 10 | 60 |
| 11 | 66 |
| 12 | 60 |
| 13 | 65 |
| 14 | 70 |
| 15 | 60 |
| 16 | 64 |
| 17 | 68 |

## Verifying commitments for the Guessing game

One can recalculate the commitment for the guessing game by using the commitment.rs binary in this crate. For a guess G with the randomness R (as hex string) and the address A (as hex string), one can calculate the commitment as:

```rust
cargo run --release --bin commitment -- --guess <G> --rand <R> --address <A>
```

Example:

```rust
cargo run --release --bin commitment -- --guess 5 --rand 0xa --address 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8
```
